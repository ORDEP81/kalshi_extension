# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in PNG format:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a simple, recognizable design that represents odds/betting
- Ensure good contrast and visibility at small sizes
- Consider using Kalshi's brand colors or complementary colors
- Icons should be square with transparent backgrounds

## Temporary Placeholder

Until proper icons are created, you can use simple colored squares or text-based icons for development and testing.
